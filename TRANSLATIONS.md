# Translation Feature Implementation

## Overview
The app uses iOS 18's Translation API to provide on-device Japanese to English translation. The translation appears below the Japanese transcription with furigana.

## Current Status
- ✅ Translation now works consistently for all recordings
- ✅ Shows "Translating..." placeholder while processing
- ✅ Each recording gets properly translated

## Implementation Details

### Language Configuration
- Source: Japanese (`ja`)
- Target: English UK (`en-GB`) - matches the installed language pack on device
- Uses `TranslationSession.Configuration` with `translationTask` modifier

### Code Structure
```swift
// In TranscriptionDisplay view
@State private var configuration: TranslationSession.Configuration?
@State private var translatedText = ""
@State private var translationAvailable = false
@State private var textToTranslate = ""

// Translation task modifier
.translationTask(configuration) { session in
    // Translate textToTranslate
    let response = try await session.translate(textToTranslate)
    self.translatedText = response.targetText
}

// Configuration update on text change
.onChange(of: transcribedText) { oldValue, newValue in
    textToTranslate = newValue
    translatedText = ""
    
    configuration = nil
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.configuration = TranslationSession.Configuration(
            source: Locale.Language(identifier: "ja"),
            target: Locale.Language(identifier: "en-GB")
        )
    }
}
```

### Language Availability Check
The app checks for installed language packs on startup:
- Checks for `en-GB`, `en-US`, and generic `en`
- Shows warning message if languages aren't installed
- Only attempts translation if languages are available

## The Problem (SOLVED)
The `translationTask` modifier would only trigger once per view lifecycle. After the initial successful translation, subsequent recordings showed Japanese text but no English translation appeared.

## Root Cause
The `translationTask` modifier in iOS 18's Translation API doesn't properly re-initialize when the configuration changes within the same view. This appears to be a framework limitation where the translation task is cached and not recreated even when the configuration is updated.

## The Solution

### Separate Translation View Component
Created a dedicated `TranslationView` that gets completely recreated for each translation:

```swift
struct TranslationView: View {
    let textToTranslate: String
    @State private var translatedText = ""
    @State private var configuration: TranslationSession.Configuration?
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 8) {
            Divider()
                .padding(.horizontal, 40)
            
            if !translatedText.isEmpty {
                Text(translatedText)
                    .font(.system(size: 20))
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                    .padding(.horizontal)
            } else {
                Text("Translating...")
                    .font(.system(size: 20))
                    .foregroundColor(.secondary.opacity(0.5))
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
                    .padding(.horizontal)
            }
        }
        .onAppear {
            // Create configuration when view appears
            configuration = TranslationSession.Configuration(
                source: Locale.Language(identifier: "ja"),
                target: Locale.Language(identifier: "en-GB")
            )
        }
        .translationTask(configuration) { session in
            // Perform translation
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Force View Recreation**: Use `.id(transcribedText)` modifier to force SwiftUI to destroy and recreate the TranslationView when text changes:
```swift
TranslationView(textToTranslate: transcribedText)
    .id(transcribedText) // Force recreation when text changes
```

2. **Always Show Content**: The view must always render something (not be hidden in a conditional) for `onAppear` to trigger. Show "Translating..." placeholder while processing.

3. **Configuration in onAppear**: Create the translation configuration in `onAppear` rather than passing it in, ensuring a fresh configuration for each view instance.

## Why This Works
- Each transcription creates a completely new TranslationView instance
- The new instance has its own translation task that properly initializes
- No state is carried over from previous translations
- The framework treats each instance as a fresh translation request

## Additional Issues Fixed

### Audio Recording Issues
During development, we encountered issues where:
1. Second recordings would capture 0 samples
2. Audio engine references became invalid due to async delays

**Solution**: 
- Create fresh `AVAudioEngine` instance for each recording
- Remove async delays that caused engine reference issues
- Ensure audio session is properly activated before each recording

### Code Cleanup
- Removed all debugging print statements from the final implementation
- Cleaned up unused state variables and configuration attempts
- Simplified the translation flow to be more maintainable

## Requirements
- iOS 18.0+
- Japanese and English language packs installed via Settings > Translate
- Physical device (doesn't work in simulator)
